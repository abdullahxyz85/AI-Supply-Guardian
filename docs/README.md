# Documentation Assets

This folder contains workflow diagrams and documentation images for the AI Supply Guardian project.

## Workflow Images

### opus-workflow.png

The Opus AI workflow diagram showing our agent orchestration architecture. This diagram was generated using Opus AI's visual workflow builder and demonstrates how we meet the hackathon's Opus AI requirement.

**Save the first image from your attachments as:** `opus-workflow.png`

### n8n-workflows.png

The n8n automation workflows that implement our production pipeline. These workflows mirror the Opus design but provide production-grade reliability and debugging capabilities.

**Save the second image from your attachments as:** `n8n-workflows.png`

## How to Add Images

1. Save both workflow screenshots to this `docs/` folder
2. Name them exactly as shown above
3. The README.md already references these images correctly

The workflow diagrams are crucial for demonstrating to hackathon judges that we're using the required technologies (Opus AI and Google Gemini API) in our architecture.
